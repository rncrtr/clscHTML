		<h2 class="entry-title">clsc for your org</h2>
		<p>We think that a good organization exists not only to profit or accomplish a goal, but also to act as an extended family for those who work in it. Part of that is paying attention to the needs of those in that family. If your organization feels the same, but like many, doesn't have a way to do that, we can help.</p>
		<h3>No one should feel ignored. Now they won't have to. clsc is the suggestion box with teeth.</h3>
		<p>
			The best way to care for your people with clsc is:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Discover:</strong> Find out what your people need <em>(in real time)</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>React:</strong> Find the generous and what they can/will do specifically to help <em>("the generous" simply like a facebook page)</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Coalesce:</strong> Bring the two together in effective ways <em>(without all the legwork)</em>.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>
				We give you the ability to care for your people in specific practical ways 
				&mdash; and let them care for each other &mdash; 
				all without having to manage the process.
			</h3>
		</p>
		<p>
			Our service is simple. People post their needs. Others who can help post what they can do to meet the need. Then, they do. Some even meet the need secretly without saying a word. Sometimes people come back from lunch to find that more than one person has done something kind to help them out. Often many people. It is like one great big happy family, or at least the good part.
