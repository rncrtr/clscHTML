						<p>Sure, everybody needs love. We aim to help as many people as we can with the resources we have, regardless of how big or how small they may be. </p>
							<br />
						<p>If your organization could use the same power we do here at clsc to serve your people better, we've setup a way for that to happen, and the small monthly fee you pay will go directly to improving and maintaining clsc for your organization and the people we are serving as well.
						</p>
							<br />
						Here's what you get:
						<ul id="bulleted">
							<li>* your own clsc network just for the needs of your people</li>
							<li>* you can accept needs from just your people, or open it up to the public if required</li>
							<li>* a facebook page to eliminate extra email and to enable 1-click generosity</li>
							<li>* premium support to help you with any issues that might arise</li>
						</ul>
